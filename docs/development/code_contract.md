# NoKV Code Contract

This repository is the Rust NoKV product line: an AI-training and
agent-workspace filesystem with Holt-backed metadata and S3-compatible object
storage.

NoKV accepts breaking internal changes when they reduce ambiguity or remove old
migration paths. Do not add forwarding wrappers, aliases, or dual execution
paths unless the PR states the operational need and removal condition.

## Package Boundaries

| Package | Owns | Must Not Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `crates/nokv-types/` | Storage-neutral namespace model: mount ids, inode ids, dentry names, inode attrs, body descriptors, record families, and typed watch events. | Import metadata layout, Holt, Raft, object-store clients, FUSE, protobuf, or service packages. |
| `crates/nokv-protocol/` | Storage-neutral metadata RPC DTOs shared by server and service clients. | Execute metadata commands, own path resolution, import Holt, object-store clients, FUSE, metadata layout, or server/client implementations. |
| `crates/nokv-meta/` | Metadata schema, Holt-friendly layout, `MetadataCommand`, Holt-backed metastore, in-process metadata service, snapshot retention pins, object-reference GC queue policy, history pruning, and service-level GC workers. | Own provider-specific object behavior, FUSE/kernel cache policy, Python bindings, CSI behavior, or wire-protocol migration behavior. |
| `crates/nokv-control/` | Shard map, owner leases, shard epochs, routing metadata, checkpoint/log pointers, and failover coordination. | Own inode/dentry semantics, chunk manifests, object GC policy, Holt internals, data-plane cache placement, FUSE behavior, or provider-specific object-store behavior. |
| `crates/nokv-object/` | Object-store boundary, S3-compatible backend, batch object reads, local hot-tier object store, tiered data-fabric helpers, soft placement resolution, and in-memory test object store for file bodies. | Own namespace metadata, import Holt/FUSE/protobuf, implement metadata transactions, or expose filesystem-directory object storage as a product backend. |
| `crates/nokv-client/` | Path-oriented Rust SDK over the metadata service and object backend. | Own metadata layout, bypass `nokv-meta`, expose object-store internals, implement FUSE/kernel cache semantics, depend on `nokv-fuse`, or define metadata wire formats. |
| `crates/nokv-fuse/` | FUSE low-level frontend, inode mapping, kernel-facing attr conversion, range reads, and close-to-open buffered writes through the metadata client/server boundary. | Resolve paths through the path SDK hot path, own metadata layout, import Holt directly, open a production metadata store, or implement object-provider-specific behavior. |
| `crates/nokv-python/` | Python SDK and fsspec binding for training workflows over `nokv-client`. | Own metadata layout, bypass `nokv-client`, implement object-provider-specific behavior, import FUSE, or reimplement Rust SDK range planning in Python. |
| `crates/nokv-server/` | Long-running metadata service process, startup config, background GC ownership, health/status/control HTTP, framed metadata RPC, and future network service boundary. | Own metadata semantics, durable layout, object provider internals, FUSE/kernel cache policy, or hidden migration behavior. |
| `crates/nokv/` | `nokv` CLI binary, command parsing, local service startup, and CLI wiring across client, FUSE, metadata, and object config. | Own metadata semantics, durable layout, object backend internals, or FUSE filesystem implementation. |
| `bench/` | System workload harnesses for metadata smoke, MLPerf Storage/DLIO-style generated training reads, checkpoint publish/read, and demo dataset shapes. | Own product APIs, metadata layout, object backend implementation, FUSE/kernel cache policy, or hidden benchmark-only behavior in product crates. |

| `crates/nokv-csi/` | Kubernetes CSI integration and mount lifecycle. |

## File Layout

Use responsibility-based file names. Avoid `utils.rs`, `helpers.rs`,
`common.rs`, and `misc.rs` unless the package is tiny and the file has one
clear responsibility.

Recommended package layout:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `lib.rs` | Package contract and public exports. |
| `types.rs` | Core domain types and interfaces. |
| `options.rs` | Construction options and validation. |
| `errors.rs` | Package error enum and conversions. |
| `codec.rs` | Durable encoding and decoding. |
| `store.rs` | Authoritative store object. |
| `service.rs` | Service boundary. |
| `tests.rs` / `*_test.rs` | Focused behavior tests. |

## Rules

- Keep filesystem semantics above storage engine bindings.
- Keep object bytes out of metadata values except compact descriptors.
- Keep local hot-tier placement and cache slots out of metadata values; they
  are data-path soft state keyed by immutable blocks.
- Use inode/dentry as canonical truth; path indexes are derived acceleration.
- Use `MetadataCommand` predicates as the atomicity fence.
- Do not leak Holt internals into types, object, client, or FUSE.
- Do not introduce provider-specific RustFS metadata semantics; RustFS uses the
  S3-compatible object backend.
- Prefer explicit invariants and local reasoning over manager-style wrappers.

## Validation

Before pushing substantial changes:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
git diff --check
```

Run the docs build when docs or navigation changes:

```bash
cd docs && npm run build
```
