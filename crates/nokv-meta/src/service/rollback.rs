    ///    child dentry. After this one commit, every lookup under `target_root`
    ///    resolves to the restored tree; `target_root` keeps its inode identity, so no
    ///    parent re-link is needed. The detached pre-rollback subtree becomes
    ///    unreachable.

    /// # GC correctness

    /// The snapshot's content and the discarded delta share inode identity (the delta
    /// mutated the very inodes the snapshot captured). The restored tree therefore
    /// borrows blocks whose keys are owned by inodes that the teardown destroys. Two
    /// rules keep the shared blocks alive while letting the delta's private blocks go:
    ///
    /// * **Teardown skips shared blocks.** The detached subtree is purged with the

    ///   [`NoKvFs::chunk_manifest_delete_and_gc_mutations`] never enqueues a block the
    ///   restored tree still points at (e.g. an unchanged file's block). Only blocks
    ///   unique to the delta (a rewritten file's new body, a delta-only file) are
    ///   enqueued.
    /// * **The swap cancels stale enqueues for restored blocks.** A pre-rollback
    ///   rewrite or delete already queued the snapshot's blocks for GC (blocked only
    ///   by the retention floor). The swap commit deletes any pending GC record whose
    ///   object key the restored tree references, resurrecting those blocks as live so
